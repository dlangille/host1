# host1
Information about the server I'm selling.

I'm not sure if I will keep the SSDs or not.

I can sell the chassis separate from the drives.

At one time, the host was as described here: https://dan.langille.org/2022/12/31/slocum-8/ and summarized here:

* M/B – Supermicro X9DRE-TF+ (included with chassis)
* RAM – 128GB composed of 8x 16GB DDR3 1600Mhz 21300 ECC/REG
* CPU – 2x E5-2620v2 – Intel Six Core 2.10Ghz Xeon 15MB cache 7.2 GT/s QPI (80W)
* chassis – SC846E16-R1200B - $500
* SAS9300-8i card connects the backplane of the chassis with the M/B - operating in IT mode (included with chassis)
* HDD – 6x Toshiba 5TB drives - $45 each
* SDD – 2x Samsung SSD 860 EVO 250GB RVT02B6Q (for the operating system) – the Sandisk SLOG was removed some time ago, I’m not sure when
* NVMe – SAMSUNG 980 PRO SSD with Heatsink 1TB PCIe Gen 4 NVMe M.2 Internal Solid State Hard Drive, Heat Control, Max Speed, PS5 Compatible, MZ-V8P1T0CW

FreeBSD installed now. I'll wipe the drives before shippping.

I'd prefer local pickup, because shipping is so much work....

I also have these two hosts to dispose of:
